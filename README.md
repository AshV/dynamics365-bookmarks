# The Dynamics 365 Bookmark collection

.. is really just that! A collection of Dynamics 365 and Power Platform relevant bookmarks, that I have started to collect and have helped me greatly in my day-to-day work so far. By no means is it perfect nor finished, but opening it up to everyone so that you all can benefit too, and hoping, we can continue to nurture it together! 

Use cases:
* When needing to set up a new workstation for a client,
* When needing a new browser profile for prototyping 
* When needing to simply get a new dev/consultant up-to-speed.

## Special cases

There are some special bookmarks (bookmarklets), that only work in given situations. One of these is the **D365 Command Checker**, which you can only use when you are in a Dynamics 365 model driven app. Mind it, ANY model driven app works, see [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/power-platform/power-apps/create-and-use-apps/ribbon-issues).
